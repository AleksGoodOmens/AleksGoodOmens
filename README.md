# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aleks, Nice to meet you!
<p>I am a passionate frontend developer based in London, with a strong foundation in modern web technologies including React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Redux. Having completed multiple advanced courses, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in building responsive, dynamic web applications.</p> 
	<p> As a self-taught and continuously learning developer, I thrive in collaborative environments, always eager to embrace new challenges and sharpen my skills. Would you be interested in collaborating on your next project?</p>
