### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aleks Gomeniuk
<p>I am a committed frontend developer from London who has self-taught and applied various frontend technologies. With knowledge of several languages, I am a team player who is always ready to collaborate. As a motivated developer, I enjoy acquiring new skills and never giving up on challenges. Would you be interested in working together?</p>

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
<p><a href="https://test.webdeveloperaleks.com/build/">coffee shop website using react</a></p>

## Completed works: 
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://webdeveloperaleks.com/portfolio/runSmart/index.html">runSmart</a>
    <div>
      # Description 
      <p>The RunSmart website was developed as a project for a front-end development course, where I utilized my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I manually coded           the HTML using semantic tags, and used Sass for styling. The layout of the website was created using both flexbox and grid positioning techniques.</p>
      <p>For the JavaScript implementation, I practiced using both jQuery and native JS. I utilized several libraries such as Slick.js for carousels, Cleave.js for input           validation, Wow.js for triggering animations, and Animated.css for animating elements.</p>
      <p>I also manually created the functionality for the tabs elements and added backflip animations for the cards. One of the notable features of the website is the             integration of Google Maps, where I added real maps with all the functionalities provided by Google Maps.</p>

      # Benefits 
      <p>This website can be used as a small online shop, providing users with the ability to view information about goods and access contact details for the seller. With its visually appealing design and user-friendly interface, the website can showcase products, provide details such as prices and product descriptions, and allow users to easily get in touch with the seller. Additionally, the website can be customized to include features such as a shopping cart and payment processing, making it a complete e-commerce solution for small businesses.</p>
