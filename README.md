### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aleks Gomeniuk
<p>I am a committed frontend developer from London who has self-taught and applied various frontend technologies. With fluency in several languages, I am a team player who is always ready to collaborate. As a motivated developer, I enjoy acquiring new skills and never giving up on challenges. Would you be interested in working together?</p>

##ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
<p><a href="https://test.webdeveloperaleks.com/build/">coffee shop website using react</a></p>

##ðŸŒ± I am currently expanding my skill set by learning
<p>React.js and completing several other online courses</p>

##âš¡ Fun fact: Why did I quit last job? I didn't get arrays.
